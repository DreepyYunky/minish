# Minish

The MINImal SHell (shortened to Minish, or msh) is a simple shell that is meant to demonstrate how a shell works, while being (mostly) cross-platform in nature (no WinAPI or unistd)

## Installation
You can find the zip file [here](https://github.com/DreepyYunky/minish/releases)

Or if you want to build from source, you can run the Makefile.
